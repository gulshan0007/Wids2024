When one friend (stock) wanders off too far, you expect them to eventually come back together. So, when one stock rises higher than usual, you sell it (go short) and buy the other one (go long), betting they’ll soon be back in sync. Now, instead of guessing how far they’ll stray before reuniting, we use a tool called the Kalman Filter, which acts like a dynamic compass. It constantly updates your expectations based on the latest movements, helping you adjust your buy-sell ratios on the fly. With PyKalman in Python, you can set this up to watch how A and B move together in real time, letting you make decisions with fresh, data-driven insights. It’s like having a GPS that reroutes as new paths open up, keeping your trading strategy smooth and responsive to the latest market trends.

We’ll take this concept to the next level by actually implementing the Kalman Filter in Python to create a model that tracks how our chosen stocks move together. First, we’ll set up the Kalman Filter to continuously update the relationship between our stock pair, adjusting for changes over time. With our dynamic model in place, we’ll simulate trades based on real-world stock data, buying or selling each stock as they drift apart and come back together.
